Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis and Clustering:
This notebook focuses on customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency,
Monetary) analysis to understand customer behavior and group similar customers
together. The dataset is first cleaned and relevant transaction-level features are
transformed into RFM metrics, where Recency measures how recently a customer made a
purchase, Frequency measures how often they purchase, and Monetary measures total
spending. These features are then scaled to ensure fair contribution during modeling, and
clustering techniques such as K-Means are applied to segment customers into distinct
groups. Each cluster is analyzed and interpreted based on its RFM characteristics to identify
high-value customers, loyal customers, regular customers, and low-engagement
customers, enabling data-driven marketing strategies and business decision-making.
